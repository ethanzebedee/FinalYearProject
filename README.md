# COMP30910-FYP: Design and Implementation-2022/23 Spring

This repository contains the code and documentation for a project on quantum machine learning algorithms used to write a thesis submitted in part fulfilment of the degree of BSc. (Hons.) in Computer Science. The aim of this project is to compare the performance of classical machine learning algorithms with quantum machine learning algorithms in various classification tasks.
